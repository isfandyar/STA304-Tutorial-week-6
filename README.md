## Overview

This repository answers the following question:

Using R Markdown, please create a graph using ggplot2 and a map using ggmap and add explanatory text to accompany both. Be sure to include cross-references and captions, etc. This should take one to two pages for each of them.

Then, for the graph, please reflect on Vanderplas, Cook, and Hofmann (2020) and add a few paragraphs about the different options that you considered that the graph more effective. (If you’ve not now got at least two pages about your graph you’ve likely written too little.)

And finally, for the map, please reflect on the following quote from Heather Krause: ‘maps only show people who aren’t invisible to the makers’ as well as Chapter 3 from D’Ignazio and Klein (2020) and add a few paragraphs related to this. (Again, if you’ve not now got at least two pages about your map you’ve likely written too little.)
